## My process

### Built with

- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

### Continued development

I still struggle a lot with hooks on React, so i think I should focus on them to understand better. And I want to learn Styled-components too.

### Useful resources

- [Event Listeners in React Components](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/event-listeners-in-react-components) - This helped me a lot on how to use useEffect and build the logic to capture the arrow keys so I could change the slides with the keyboard. It was everything very new to me, and I don't think that I fully understand it but I plan to study the topic better.
